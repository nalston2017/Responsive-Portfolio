          <p>Since graduating from the Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 2011 (with a Masters in Business Administration), I have held several positions in the Accounting field. The experiences that I have gained from these positions have ultimately
            led me to enroll in George Washington University's Coding Bootcamp for Web Development. </p>
          <p>I started out working as an auditor for a small CPA firm. The firm had just begun to use the auditing software called Teammate. Without any formal training, within a year I was hosting Teammate training for the entire firm with staff from all
            levels, from entry to the owner of the firm. There I realized that programs can be very dynamic as long as you knew “how to talk to it.” </p>
          <p>In 2013, I left the CPA firm and I became an Accountant at a company called Intelsat. There I was able to start utilizing Visual Basic Applications to create process improvements and automation. I started to enjoy creating these small programs
            more than accounting. I left Intelsat in 2016 to take a position at Washington Gas Light where my sole focus would we developing process improvement with their Accounting and Finance Departments. I really enjoy my job but have realized that
            accounting is not for me and that a career or working with computers should be my primary focus. I hope that the experience I will gain in the Coding Bootcamp at GW can facilitate this. That I will be able to bring ideas that I have had in
            the past to life and forge a future for myself that is independent of the Accounting Profession. </p>
